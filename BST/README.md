# BST
This demonstrates the most basic Binary Search Tree (BST) search operations.
Exact match - recursively traverses the nodes to find an exact match againt the current node the execution is visiting. The base condition of recursion is either an exact match or null value of a child node (right and left)

Nearest match - also recursive search but with an additional parameter to carry throught out the traversal to record the current nearest node.
